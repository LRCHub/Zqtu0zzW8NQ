Wild motion running through your life
Helps you to ease your mind, be still sometimes
Two coastlines settle in your gaze
You fell asleep for days, but you don't mind

They rush to take their time
Shootin' around the lines, that's what they do
Tin can philosophy
The original novelty, that's what you are

Wine and liquor pouring down your drain
It settles on your brain, what a great escape
I never learn to love no one
Focused on havin' fun

They rush to take their time
Shootin' around the lines, that's what they do
Tin can philosophy
The original novelty, that's what you are
First scene of your tragedy
Sorry for laughing at you
They over-intellectualize
But you taught them how to improvise, didn't you?
